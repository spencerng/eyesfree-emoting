# eyesfree-emoting


Eyes-free interfaces for sending and receiving emojis via touch and vibration. 

Created by [Dawei Huang](https://github.com/huangdaweiUCHICAGO), [Kate Lu](https://github.com/Kate32815), [Spencer Ng](https://github.com/spencerng), and [Ece Varol](https://github.com/ecevaroll) for [CMSC 20300 - Introduction to Human Computer Interaction](https://hciintro20.plopes.org/) at the University of Chicago in Fall 2020.

## Usage

* Navigate to [our website](https://bit.ly/eyesfree-emoting) and tap to begin
* Select a send or receive method to learn the emoji encodings associated with it, then test your accuracy!

For best compatibility with the interfaces, please ensure the following requirements are met:
  * You are using **Google Chrome** on an **Android device**
  * Your **Media Volume** is turned on
  * The phone is set to **"Sound" or "Vibrate"** mode, *not* "Silent"
  
## User study

Our original user study for A/B testing of the two interfaces is now over, but we'd love to see your results by filling out [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXOB5pylZz6Jp3fEsdTIih4lgqnW8QBCaNVgyWDyqEfSbWag/viewform)!
